// Simulating a circuit has four phases (not precisely in order of execution):
// 1. Building a simulation graph made of SimulationComponents.
// 2. Merging all the necessary dependencies.
// 3. Analyse the graph to look for errors, such as unconnected ports,
//    combinatorial loops, etc...
// 4. Setting the values of the input nodes of the graph to kickstart the
//    simulation process.

/// Builds the graph and simulates it with all inputs zeroed.
